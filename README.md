# draw-r

> "A picture is worth a thousand words"

The goal of this project is to provide diagrams or schemes of relevant _R_ 
functionality.
Diagrams contained within this project are made using either 
[Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/) or
[Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle). 


**Note:** These diagrams are static. If you are looking to understand how your 
code works, please see:

- ... ? 

## Development Notice

These materials have been developed for use in STAT 385: Statistics Programming Methods at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). As such, the diagrams may change
or evolve over time.

## Motivation

The idea for the `draw-r` project was the result of needing to describe the differences between an 
_R_ function and a _C++_ function for the paper
_[Extending R with C++: A Brief Introduction to Rcpp](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375990)_ with 
[Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/) in 
the American Statistician's
**Special** [Issue on Data Science](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/72/1).
[Bob Rudis](https://rud.is/), who was one of the two reviewers for our paper,
supplied alongside his feedback a much better version of the _C++_ function 
diagram. The diagram evoked pure beauty due to its minimalist design
being largely directed by [gestalt principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping).
The overall simplistic of this diagramming form really drove me to want to 
implement it in not only the paper but also in the instructional materials I
create. Bob constructed the initial diagram using 
[Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle), which is a pricy macOS piece
of software akin to [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software)'s 
diagramming functionality. You can find the initial diagram and rendered output
in the `functions` folder.
